				<h2 class="bd-title" id="heading_industry">The Industry</h2>
				<p class="bd-lead text-larger">Computation is an <b>incredible</b> asset to the pharmaceutical industry.
					The progress of pharmaceuticals has accelerated drastically with the introduction of computers,
					allowing scientists to focus their efforts on innovation on developing new medinices, while the
					slow, repetitive, and necessary work happens in the background.<br>A less medically-focused example
					is budgeting software. It allows labs to optimise their cash flow (which they often have a lot of),
					helping them invest more into research instead of spending time sorting their finances out. Another
					example of computers being incredibly useful is the supply chain, allowing rapid requests and
					deliveries of critical equipment and reagents. <br>But these aren't even directly related to
					medicine - read on to find the top 3 computation benefits in pharma!</p>

				<p class="bd-lead text-larger">In the old days, we tested everything that was believed to be a medicine.
					As you might expect, most of these things <i>weren't</i> medicines. We progressed onto testing on
					living creatures similar biologically to humans, like monkeys. We know how people responded to that.
					Although we still trial with animals and rodents, a new contender has emerged: the
					computer.<br>Advanced simulations and models enable rapid testing of potential drugs, and their
					influence, on smaller closed systems. This is not yet anywhere near the accuracy of testing on live
					subjects, but it can often indicate the approximate results and timescales.</p>

				<p class="bd-lead text-larger">Not unlike the applications of computers in solving mathematical or
					technological problems, they can also be used to solve biological problems. A prime example of this
					is Google Deepmind's AlphaFold project in 2021. It applied cutting-edge artificial intelligence
					technology to solve problems, at a rate of orders of magnitude faster than it's predecessors. The
					problem in question was protein folding - predicting protein structures based on a protein sequence.
					This has tremendous applications in bio-science, and unlocks the door for medical companies to
					investigate this branch of science much more readily.<br>A similar project that you have likely
					heard of was Fold@Home, a distributed computation solution to achieve the same thing, also using
					computers.</p>

				<p class="bd-lead text-larger">The field of finance and economy is dominated by mathematics, the kind of
					field that computation is designed to process. It leads to, no surprise, mathematical models of the
					market. Big Pharmaceutical can apply such models to maximise their sales and offerings in ways that
					would otherwise be difficult and wildly inconsistent. These models, often applying Machine Learning
					to predict scenarios, will map out the spread, distribution, and demand of various types of drugs
					and treatments. This allows corporate to maximise profits more easily, which in turn creates more
					budget for the scientists who develop medicine. More budget means more science, and it's all
					possible thanks to computation!</p>
